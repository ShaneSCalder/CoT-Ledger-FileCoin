# üõ∞Ô∏è Filecoin AI Upload Agent

A guided assistant to upload, summarize, compile, and deploy metadata to the Filecoin Calibration testnet ‚Äî powered by AI and smart contract automation.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This app allows users to:

- üìÅ Upload a JSON file
- üß† Generate a summary using AI
- üîê Connect MetaMask and switch to Filecoin Calibration testnet
- üìú Compile and deploy a smart contract to store references to the data (CID, metadata hash, summary)
- üíæ Generate and download a `metadata.json` file
- üéâ Get confirmation of deployed contract and transaction

The UI is presented in a clean **modal-style interface** for easy interaction and presentation.

## üõ† Features

‚úÖ Upload .json data file

‚úÖ Generate summary, cid, and metadataHash

‚úÖ Connect and verify MetaMask network (Filecoin Calibration)

‚úÖ Compile Solidity smart contract via solc-js in browser

## üîó Technologies Used

Node.js + Express

EJS Templates

ethers.js

MetaMask

IPFS

solc-js (in-browser)

Filecoin Calibration Testnet

## üì• Metadata Example

```
{
  "cid": "bafy...",
  "metadataHash": "f83c7b...",
  "summary": "This JSON contains multiple memo entries...",
  "contractAddress": "0x123456...",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-25T17:00:00Z",
  "source": "Filecoin AI Upload Agent"
}
```

---

## üí° Notes
Contract source is AI-generated per file summary.

All logic runs in the browser (no backend contract deployment needed).

Uses solc-js in a secure Web Worker to compile Solidity in-browser.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security
All transactions require user approval via MetaMask.

Contracts are deployed to Filecoin Calibration testnet only.

CIDs and metadata are immutable and viewable on IPFS.

---

## üß™ Future Ideas
AI chat interface for follow-up questions

Verifiable metadata explorer

On-chain proof-of-upload via EAS or attestation layer

IPFS pinning checker

## üì¶ IPFS Integration (Production Note)

In this example, the Filecoin Calibration Testnet is used to demonstrate the AI upload, smart contract deployment, and metadata handling process.

### üìå In a production environment:

- You would incorporate IPFS (e.g., via [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage) or [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud)) to upload and store files persistently.
- The real CID (Content Identifier) returned from IPFS would be used for smart contract logging.
- This ensures decentralized and verifiable access to the uploaded data across the Filecoin/IPFS network.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For demo purposes, CIDs and metadata are simulated. In production, the upload flow should include actual IPFS integration for long-term storage and public access.
